#' Compute weight matrix for the clusterpath penalty of the Clusterpath Gaussian
#' Graphical Model
#'
#' This function computes the (possibly sparse) weight matrix that is used in
#' CGGM. Weights are computed using exp{-phi * norm(Theta, i, j)^2}, where the
#' squared norm of two rows of Theta are scaled by the average squared norm of
#' all the rows of Theta. Additionally, groups of variables that would not be
#' connected via nonzero weights due to the sparsity of the weight matrix can
#' still be connected by applying a minimum spanning tree algorithm.
#'
#' @param S The sample covariance matrix of the data.
#' @param phi Tuning parameter of the weights.
#' @param k The number of nearest neighbors that should be used to set weights
#' to a nonzero value. If \code{0 < k < ncol(S)}, the dense weight matrix will
#' be made sparse, otherwise the dense matrix is returned.
#' @param connected Boolean that indicates whether a connected weight matrix
#' should be enforced. Defaults to \code{TRUE}.
#'
#' @return A weight matrix.
